# SMAI Final Project

## Project Proposal

### For the record
- **Project ID**: 30
- **Team number**: 7
- **Team name**: Random_team_0
- **Project title**: Detecting rumor and stance (bias) jointly by Neural Multi-Task Learning

### Team Members
- Animesh Das (20161302)
- Ali Hussaini (20161204)
- Thapaswini Kancharla (20161066)
- Issac Balaji (20163051)

### Main goal of the project
- Implementing Neural Multi-Task Learning.
- Detecting rumor and stance jointly using the above method.

### Problem definition
- Problem is to make a Neural Multi-Task Learning Model to detect rumor and stance jointly.
- We'll first implement baselines for detecting rumours and bias. A good one to go with would be a logistic regression modle.
- A further extension, which involves has been provided in the following paper: http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3190000/3188729/p585-ma.pdf
- We choose to implement two out of the many models given in this paper.
- A good place to start would be collecting data from Twitter as specified in section 6.1 of the above-mentioned paper.


### Results of the project
- Accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Tasks for each member
- Not yet decided.
